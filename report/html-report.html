    <section id="architecture">
        <h1> 2. Project architecture </h1>
        <p> Our main focus is on a single system divided in an MVC style. C4 was appropriate for designing such plan. The following will cover the essentials one by one. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Context</b> The ECAW software system is making use of a multitude of APIs which provide visual and audio content. 
                The reason is clear while the application is meant to provide as many ways to import content as possible. 
                The scheme shows for now only the essential content APIs. Atlas will ultimatelly be used for storing our non-relational database in cloud. </li>
            <li><b>Container </b> There are several containers ECAW makes use of. Clearly there is a client side massive code-base which
                will be enclosed in the one-page application container, delivered directly to the user. Here will rely most of our
                bussiness logic. The Web Server will serve only as a gateway to the server side logic. It will support the client HTTP request and
                afterwards, content related queries which will be passed to the Data handling API. This will be the main controller over the backing data.
                Outside it will prove as a facade for the rest of the containers, while inside, this will respond to the queries/updates. 
                Finnaly, the Database is backed by the MongoDB engine, as it fits the NodeJS ecosystem used. </li>
            <li><b>Component </b> The only component which will figure here will be the client-side container's components. While the server side
                should deal only with API calls and database basic operations, the client in responsible with managing the user interaction, which
                in this case, is considerable. It splits the code-base in 4 components: 3 of them are drawing related and 1 is administrative. The
                Canvas is the crucial component while this handles the positional and displaying features. The Tools Component is evidently mandatory,
                and is responsible with adding content to the canvas. More exactly, it will call the server for getting the source of one primitive, or
                it will respond with a default value. The last drawing component is the Customization one. This will let the user change the 
                proprieties of one widget/shape inside the canvas. Ultimatelly, the collage manipulator is a basic API exploiting component which will
                deliver the API functionalieties directly to the user.</li>
            <li><b>Code</b> No code scheme is yet figured. As a regular application, this is not appropriate for a summary of the architecture.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="functionalities">
        <h1> 6. Functionalities </h1>
        <h3 id="func_1"> 6.1 Basic primitive drawing</h3>
        <p> For the start, the main functionality provided is the adding of several primitives onto a canvas. The primitives right now are:
            text, shape, image, audio, video. The position style is highly dependent on the content type (rotation, size, overlap etc.).
            The content adding will be done with the drag and drop events using the two components: Tools and Canvas. Due to the standard 
            content maniputalion tools, ECAW will deliver easy to use interface tools for scaling and other geometry translations.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_2"> 6.2 Customization</h3>
        <p>  
            The widgets/shapes inside the canvas are customizable in a way dependent of the content type. This feature is scalable, as there are
            lots of ways in which one specific shape can be customized (colors, borders, text style, autoplay etc.). Furthermore, a powerful
            feature as it is independent from the content source and initial contraints, thus meaning it can provide the exact settings for 
            two images for example, for the layout sake. This also works on a hybrid combination (between a video and a text), which are meant to
            be aligned after a user defined layout.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_3"> 6.3 External source</h3>
        <p> 
            While the text and shape widgets are meant to be user-defined, the audio, video and image do require a source. On a low scale, the source
            can be provided by the user by upload. However, due to the increasingly efficiency of online storing services, ECAW provides a suite of
            providers which can be used in order to import custom data. This is evidently highly scalable, as potential new APIs will be easily
            increase the impact of this feature.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_4"> 6.4 Save and load </h3>
        <p> 
            As this administrative feature is mandatory for such projects, save and load will deliver an increased user experience. The saving will
            be done under a XML format for easy storing. This is also be available for cloud storing, as one collage can be passed to another user via
            the application (see the sharing feature). Nevertheless to say, a collage can be saved internally through user interaction (saving the collage
            on the device) or through cookies (saving the state of one collage automatically - this should also be taken in consideration as an efficiency issue).
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_5"> 6.5 Sharing</h3>
        <p> 
            This event is delivered as a feature as long as the API behind has such interaction implemented. This means that, the administrative
            actions are a consequence of trying to exploit the back API, which will provide the sharing ability. However, the API is scalable in terms
            of features, thus other new events will be available depending on the powerhouse's level.

            Sharing for example will be used for working on the same collage as other user. Depending on the implementation, this will support concurrency
            or not. The initial versions will rather focus on getting the things done under a non-concurent manner, while later versions may exploit this 
            feature.
        </p>

    <section id="api">
        <h1> 7. External APIs </h1>
        <h3 id= "api_1"> 7.1 Youtube API</h3>
        <p> 
            For sure a boost for the application, as Youtube provides a wide range of videos which can join the canvas. As a content provider, 
            it mainly focuses on videos and it starts as the best solution of a free video API for now. The OAuth gate towards the API might make
            the API not that easy to access, but in the end the effort will be worth. Furthermore, some of other API's require similar authentification
            method, thus a component once done can exploit this type of APIs.
        </p>
        <h3 id= "api_2"> 7.2 RandomCat API </h3>
        <p> 
            An free and very easy to use API which can provide resonable content for a collage. This one is an image provider which can
            contribute to the external sources feature. 
            No need to use any special authentificating process, but rather only HTTP calls which will return JSON content. This type of API
            provides a low effort high impact boost towards the user experience.
        </p>
        <h3 id= "api_3"> 7.3 Giphy API</h3>
        <p> 
            Due to the recent trends, a gif is highly adequate for such application. Furthermore Giphy is a high appreciated gif provider,
            thus worthy to be taken aboard. This (third) API uses an API key based authentification, thus the server will have mechanisms for all kind
            of APIs, having a scalable implementation towards adding new APIs (with any kind of free authorization).
        </p>
        <h3 id= "api_4"> 7.4 SoundCloud API</h3>
        <p> 
            Finally, there should be an audio delivery service and SoundCloud API is fitting the profile. Therefore audio widgets can be added now
            through the SoundCloud API. Similar to the Youtube API, it requires an OAuth method of authentificating the application. Unfortunately,
            these APIs are not from the save provider, thus separate efforts should be done in order to authorize ECAW.
