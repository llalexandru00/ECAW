    <section id="introduction">
        <h1> 1. Introduction </h1>
        <img src="images/logo.png" style = "width:20%">
        <p> 
            ECAW is an extensible web application for digitaly creation of collages and sharing them among other.
            The application will provide a virtual canvas where the users will contribute with diverse types of
            content: text, images, video, audio and geometric shapes etc. Users can upload custom content or make
            use of the external public APIs. For editting, operations like redo, drag&drop etc. will be implemented, 
            including hot keys support. The virtual collage can be sharen among several social networks or email.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="architecture">
        <h1> 2. Project architecture </h1>
        <p> Our main focus is on a single system divided in an MVC style. C4 was appropriate for designing such plan. The following will cover the essentials one by one. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Context</b> The ECAW software system is no longer using exernal APIs, due to e reinventing of the application. </li>
            <li><b>Container </b> There are several containers ECAW makes use of. Clearly there is a client side massive code-base which
                will be enclosed in the one-page application container, delivered directly to the user. The client-side is the only
                one finally implemented due to the heacy work that relied on this. This means this does not rely on a server-side;
                any functionality is directly implemented in plain JS, thus in the front-end. Fabirc and File-Saver are the only API used here </li>
            <li><b>Component </b> The only component which will figure here will be the client-side container's components. The client in responsible with managing the user interaction, which
                in this case, is considerable. It splits the code-base in 4 components: 3 of them are drawing related and 1 is administrative. The
                Canvas is the crucial component while this handles the positional and displaying features. The Tools Component is evidently mandatory,
                and is responsible with adding content to the canvas. More exactly, it will call the server for getting the source of one primitive, or
                it will respond with a default value. The last drawing component is the Customization one. This will let the user change the 
                proprieties of one widget/shape inside the canvas. Ultimatelly, the collage manipulator is a basic API exploiting component which will
                deliver the API functionalieties directly to the user.</li>
            <li><b>Code</b> No code scheme is yet figured. As a regular application, this is not appropriate for a summary of the architecture.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="mvc">
        <h1> 3. MVC Model</h1>
        <p> The client side adopted MVC to model the data flow here. It was required as the code-base is hard to manipulate at this stage
            due to its dimension. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="mvc_1"> 3.1 Model </h3>
        <p> The model is related to the encapsulation of the fabric base classes, in order to have an easy and transparent mode of use. </p>
        <h3 id="mvc_2"> 3.2 View </h3>
        <p> The view is composed by the basic interface reuired to work in the browser, and it makes use of the back functionalities. </p>
        <h3 id="mvc_3"> 3.3 Controller </h3>
        <p> The controllers are handling the back data by making use of the models in behind, which are finally displayed in the view.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="functionalities">
        <h1> 4. Functionalities </h1>
        <h3 id="func_1"> 4.1 Basic primitive drawing</h3>
        <p> For the start, the main functionality provided is the adding of several primitives onto a canvas. The primitives right now are:
            text, shape, image, audio, video. The position style is highly dependent on the content type (rotation, size, overlap etc.).
            The content adding will be done with the drag and drop events using the two components: Tools and Canvas. Due to the standard 
            content maniputalion tools, ECAW will deliver easy to use interface tools for scaling and other geometry translations.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_2"> 4.2 Customization</h3>
        <p>  
            The widgets/shapes inside the canvas are customizable in a way dependent of the content type. This feature is scalable, as there are
            lots of ways in which one specific shape can be customized (colors, borders, text style, autoplay etc.). Furthermore, a powerful
            feature as it is independent from the content source and initial contraints, thus meaning it can provide the exact settings for 
            two images for example, for the layout sake. This also works on a hybrid combination (between a video and a text), which are meant to
            be aligned after a user defined layout.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_3"> 4.3 External source</h3>
        <p> 
            While the text and shape widgets are meant to be user-defined, images do require a source. On a low scale, the source
            can be provided by the user by upload.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_4"> 4.4 Save and load </h3>
        <p> 
            As this administrative feature is mandatory for such projects, save and load will deliver an increased user experience. The saving will
            be done under a JSON format for easy storing. Nevertheless to say, a collage can be saved internally through user interaction (saving the collage
            on the device) or through cookies (saving the state of one collage automatically - this should also be taken in consideration as an efficiency issue).
        </p>

    <section id="technologies">
        <h1> 5. Technologies </h1>
        <h3 id="tech_1"> 5.1 Front end - HTML</h3>
        <p> 
            HTML is a marking language used for creating web pages which can be displayed inside a browser. HTML's role is
            to present the information: paragraph, fonts, tables etc. rather than describing the semantics of the document.<br>
            HTML is the abbreviation for Hyper Text Mark-up Language and is the code with resides at the base of the web pages. <br>
            HTML pages are based on tags and have the .html or .htm extension. In their vast majority this tags come in pairs, an opening one
            and a closing one (however there are also cases in which there are single tags). The web navigator interprets this tags displaying
            the result on the screen. The HTML is a language which does not separate lower case from upper case. <br>
            The main page of one domain is the index.html/index.htm file. This page is meant to be displayed automatically on a domain entrance.<br>
            For example, by visiting www.name.com, the page www.name.com/index.html is displayed.<br>
            Some tags allow the usage of attributes with cusom values. 
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_2"> 5.2 Front end - CSS</h3>
        <p> 
            CSS is a standard for element formatting inside a HTML docuemnt. Styles can be attached to the HTML elemenets by
            importing external files or from inside the document through the style tag or the style attribute. CSS can be used
            to format XHTML, XML and SVGL.<br>
            CSS3 is an upgrade which brings in some new attrbiutes and helps the development of new concepts in the web design.<br>
            Some of the most important new modules added to this standard for formatting the HTML elements bring a considerable
            step forward in developing in terms of web design.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_3"> 5.3 Front end - Javscript</h3>
        <p> 
            JavaScript is an OOP language based on protoype concept. It is used especially for introducing new functionalities in web
            pages; the JavaScript code being executed by the browser. The language is well known for its usage inside web site building,
            but it is used for embedded objects access in other applications. It was initially developed by Brendan Eich from Netscape 
            Communication Corporation under the name of Mocha, then LiveScript and finally as JavaScript.<br>
            Beside its name and some syntax similarities, between JavaScript and the Java language there is no link. Like in Java, JavaScript
            has a syntax close to C's one, but it has way more in common with Self language rather than Java.<br>
            Until the beginning of 2005, the last existing version was JavaScript 1.5, which corresponds to the third edition of ECMA-262,
            ECMAScript, in other words, a standard edition of JavaScript. The versions of Mozilla starting from 1.8 Beta 1 have a support 
            for E4X, which is an extension of the language which has to deal with XML, defined in the ECMA-357 standard. The current version
            of Mozilla, 1.8.1 (over which Firefox and Thunderbird 2.0 are built) supports JavaScript 1.7.<br>
            The newest usage of Javascript is related to the scripting of web pages. The web developers can encapsulate in HTML pages
            scripts for diverse activities like data validation or menu creation and other animated effects.<br>
            The browsers store the representation of one web page under a tree object and provide this to the JavaScript, which can start
            manipulate them. The object tree is named Document Object Model (DOM). There is W3C standard for the DOM which should be delivered
            by the browser, which start the idea of writing portable scripts, which should work the same on all browsers. In reality, the W3C
            standard for the DOM is not completely implemented. However the tendency of the browsers is to align the W3C standard, some of them
            still have incompatibility issues (Internet Explorer).<br>
            A more popular technique of building the web pages in the recent times is AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). This technique 
            presumes exeuting HTTP calls in the background without reloading the page, thus updating only parts of the DOM. AJAX permits the building
            of web interfaces with small response time, because the expensive operation of reloading the HTML complete can be removed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_4"> 5.4 Back End</h3>
        <p> 
            Node.js is an environment for running Javascript, open-platform, multi-platform, which executes JavaScript code outside the browser. NodeJS
            allows the developers to use JavaScript for command line commands development and for server-side scripts - running this way, dynamic content
            can be created to be efficiently send to the client. Thus Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying the development of
            web applications around a single programming langauge, way above the different languages for scripts from the server side and client side. <br>
            However js is the standard file extension for JavaScript code, the "Node.js" name does not describe a different type of file in this context but
            is just the name of the product. Node.js has an architecture based on events capable of asynchronous I/O. This development tools pursue optimizing
            the workrate and the scalability inside web applications with lots of I/O operations, togheter with real time web applications (for example:
            programs of communicating in real time ori browser games.)<br>
            The development project shared by Node.js, under the rights of Node.js foundation, is boosted by the collaboration programme of Linux Foundation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_5"> 5.6 Version control</h3>
        <p> 
            As already mandatory, the version control used for this application will be git, being hosted finally by GitHub. This is a normal choice after all
            as both developers do have exeperience in working in such environment. Speaking of its usability, git will allow concurent development without
            being an overhead.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_6"> 5.7 Server and OS </h3>
        <p> 
            The server used will be provided by NodeJS, due to its powerful means of delivering server work. Express will be considered as an framework in order to
            simplify the server side work. The Web server may not have such workload in order to request powerful tools. The API however will need to 
            have a strong impementation in orde to fullfil the multiple tasks it has. The OS used is not yet relevant, as the deployment will be done over
            multiple OSs (mainly Windows and Linux). The server should be built in a non dependent fashion.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="usage">
        <h1> 6. Usage </h1>
        <h3 id="usage_1"> 6.1 Drawing</h3>
        <p> 
            One can make use of the existing controls in order to manipulate the contents inside the cavas. By pressing one figure, the 
            control buttons will appear. The ones around the shape are used for scaling, while the circle above is used for rotating.
            By dragging the object, will move it around the canvas. It can go out of the canvas, but only the part indside will be displayed.
        </p>
        <h3 id="usage_2"> 6.2 Toolbar</h3>
        <p> 
            There is a toolbar for adding new objects to the canvas: a text, rectangle, circle or image. Each one of those has a specific modal
            from which the required configuration can be chosed. After pressing the submit button, the selected object with that specific
            details will be created in the upper-left corner. From this point now on, the object can be manipulated.
        </p>
        <h3 id="usage_3"> 6.3 Customization</h3>
        <p> 
            By selecting an object inside, the customization panel will be updated with the configuration of the selected component. Now, the 
            modifications on there do update in real time the canvas. The options there are exactly the same as the ones in the modals generated
            by the toolbar. If multiple objects are selected, only the first one in the selection will be eligible for customization.
        </p>
        <h3 id="usage_4"> 6.4 Handling</h3>
        <p> 
            The handling menu can be used for functionalities regarding the whole canvas. There is a save/load button which is used for internally
            saving the canvas as a JSON, or loading it in the current canvas. When loading the old content will be erased. The export button will
            generate a png for one to save the canvas. Finally, the clear button will erase everything in the canvas.
        </p>
        <h3 id="usage_5"> 6.5 Hotkeys</h3>
        <p> 
            The canvas can be also manipulated using hotkeys. This means that there are shortcuts which do several things: Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V do
            as expected: they copy the curent selection and clones it in the canvas. Del key will delete the current selection (this also works
            on a multiple selection). The G and U keys are used to group and ungroup the selection, making the objects selected as one single
            object which can be manipulated as a whole.
        </p>
