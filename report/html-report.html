        <h1> 1. Introduction </h1>
        <img src="images/logo.png" style = "width:20%">
        <p> 
            ECAW is an extensible web application for digitaly creation of collages and sharing them among other.
            The application will provide a virtual canvas where the users will contribute with diverse types of
            content: text, images, video, audio and geometric shapes etc. Users can upload custom content or make
            use of the external public APIs. For editting, operations like redo, drag&drop etc. will be implemented, 
            including hot keys support. The virtual collage can be sharen among several social networks or email.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="architecture">
        <h1> 2. Project architecture </h1>
        <p> Our main focus is on a single system divided in an MVC style. C4 was appropriate for designing such plan. The following will cover the essentials one by one. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Context</b> The ECAW software system is making use of a multitude of APIs which provide visual and audio content. 
                The reason is clear while the application is meant to provide as many ways to import content as possible. 
                The scheme shows for now only the essential content APIs. Atlas will ultimatelly be used for storing our non-relational database in cloud. </li>
            <li><b>Container </b> There are several containers ECAW makes use of. Clearly there is a client side massive code-base which
                will be enclosed in the one-page application container, delivered directly to the user. Here will rely most of our
                bussiness logic. The Web Server will serve only as a gateway to the server side logic. It will support the client HTTP request and
                afterwards, content related queries which will be passed to the Data handling API. This will be the main controller over the backing data.
                Outside it will prove as a facade for the rest of the containers, while inside, this will respond to the queries/updates. 
                Finnaly, the Database is backed by the MongoDB engine, as it fits the NodeJS ecosystem used. </li>
            <li><b>Component </b> The only component which will figure here will be the client-side container's components. While the server side
                should deal only with API calls and database basic operations, the client in responsible with managing the user interaction, which
                in this case, is considerable. It splits the code-base in 4 components: 3 of them are drawing related and 1 is administrative. The
                Canvas is the crucial component while this handles the positional and displaying features. The Tools Component is evidently mandatory,
                and is responsible with adding content to the canvas. More exactly, it will call the server for getting the source of one primitive, or
                it will respond with a default value. The last drawing component is the Customization one. This will let the user change the 
                proprieties of one widget/shape inside the canvas. Ultimatelly, the collage manipulator is a basic API exploiting component which will
                deliver the API functionalieties directly to the user.</li>
            <li><b>Code</b> No code scheme is yet figured. As a regular application, this is not appropriate for a summary of the architecture.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="db">
        <h1> 3. Database </h1>
        <p> The database scheme is slim as it does not really represent the main focus of the architecture. It consists of two tables: content and id.
            The enclosing data are basic, thus reflecting only the required information in order to make the model appropriate for the application.
        </p>

        <p> <img src="images/database_structure.png" alt="Database Structure"/> </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mvc">
        <h1> 4. MVC Model</h1>
        <p> The MVC (model - view - controller) is an architectural model used by the software engineering. The success is due to the isolation
            of the bussiness logic from the interface, thus resulting in a application where the visual level and/or the inferior levels of the 
            bussiness logic are easier to modify, without affecting the other levels.
        </p>
        <h3 id="mvc_1"> 4.1 Model </h3>
        <p> This part manipulates the logic operations (send prior by the superior level) to result in a component easier to understand. </p>
        <h3 id="mvc_2"> 4.2 View </h3>
        <p> This component is responsible for the graphics, in other words, the display of the already proccessed data. Its role is to manage the data until it riches the controller. </p>
        <h3 id="mvc_3"> 4.3 Controller </h3>
        <p> Due to this component we can control the access towards the application. They can be files, scripts or programs, in general any kind allowed by the interface. This way we can make the content more diverse in terms of dynamics, and static in the same time.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="functionalities">
        <h1> 6. Functionalities </h1>
        <h3 id="func_1"> 6.1 Basic primitive drawing</h3>
        <p> For the start, the main functionality provided is the adding of several primitives onto a canvas. The primitives right now are:
            text, shape, image, audio, video. The position style is highly dependent on the content type (rotation, size, overlap etc.).
            The content adding will be done with the drag and drop events using the two components: Tools and Canvas. Due to the standard 
            content maniputalion tools, ECAW will deliver easy to use interface tools for scaling and other geometry translations.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_2"> 6.2 Customization</h3>
        <p>  
            The widgets/shapes inside the canvas are customizable in a way dependent of the content type. This feature is scalable, as there are
            lots of ways in which one specific shape can be customized (colors, borders, text style, autoplay etc.). Furthermore, a powerful
            feature as it is independent from the content source and initial contraints, thus meaning it can provide the exact settings for 
            two images for example, for the layout sake. This also works on a hybrid combination (between a video and a text), which are meant to
            be aligned after a user defined layout.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_3"> 6.3 External source</h3>
        <p> 
            While the text and shape widgets are meant to be user-defined, the audio, video and image do require a source. On a low scale, the source
            can be provided by the user by upload. However, due to the increasingly efficiency of online storing services, ECAW provides a suite of
            providers which can be used in order to import custom data. This is evidently highly scalable, as potential new APIs will be easily
            increase the impact of this feature.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_4"> 6.4 Save and load </h3>
        <p> 
            As this administrative feature is mandatory for such projects, save and load will deliver an increased user experience. The saving will
            be done under a XML format for easy storing. This is also be available for cloud storing, as one collage can be passed to another user via
            the application (see the sharing feature). Nevertheless to say, a collage can be saved internally through user interaction (saving the collage
            on the device) or through cookies (saving the state of one collage automatically - this should also be taken in consideration as an efficiency issue).
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_5"> 6.5 Sharing</h3>
        <p> 
            This event is delivered as a feature as long as the API behind has such interaction implemented. This means that, the administrative
            actions are a consequence of trying to exploit the back API, which will provide the sharing ability. However, the API is scalable in terms
            of features, thus other new events will be available depending on the powerhouse's level.

            Sharing for example will be used for working on the same collage as other user. Depending on the implementation, this will support concurrency
            or not. The initial versions will rather focus on getting the things done under a non-concurent manner, while later versions may exploit this 
            feature.
        </p>
        <h3 id="func_6"> 6.6 Login </h3>
        <p> 
            This will be a feature regarding the login/sign up paradigm. This is clearly what is supposed to handle, thus the focus of this topic should be 
            rather what value will bring onto the application. Mainly a way of saving one callage in a digital form. This can be done by the cloud saving feature.
            However the login will help one visualize its particular creation and extend the idea of one individual collage to a collection of collages. This is a
            very scalable feature as it allows uniquely identifying creations. Basically this is a way of managing the content in a more fashionable way.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="api">
        <h1> 7. External APIs </h1>
        <h3 id= "api_1"> 7.1 Youtube API</h3>
        <p> 
            For sure a boost for the application, as Youtube provides a wide range of videos which can join the canvas. As a content provider, 
            it mainly focuses on videos and it starts as the best solution of a free video API for now. The OAuth gate towards the API might make
            the API not that easy to access, but in the end the effort will be worth. Furthermore, some of other API's require similar authentification
            method, thus a component once done can exploit this type of APIs.
        </p>
        <h3 id= "api_2"> 7.2 RandomCat API </h3>
        <p> 
            An free and very easy to use API which can provide resonable content for a collage. This one is an image provider which can
            contribute to the external sources feature. 
            No need to use any special authentificating process, but rather only HTTP calls which will return JSON content. This type of API
            provides a low effort high impact boost towards the user experience.
        </p>
        <h3 id= "api_3"> 7.3 Giphy API</h3>
        <p> 
            Due to the recent trends, a gif is highly adequate for such application. Furthermore Giphy is a high appreciated gif provider,
            thus worthy to be taken aboard. This (third) API uses an API key based authentification, thus the server will have mechanisms for all kind
            of APIs, having a scalable implementation towards adding new APIs (with any kind of free authorization).
        </p>
        <h3 id= "api_4"> 7.4 SoundCloud API</h3>
        <p> 
            Finally, there should be an audio delivery service and SoundCloud API is fitting the profile. Therefore audio widgets can be added now
            through the SoundCloud API. Similar to the Youtube API, it requires an OAuth method of authentificating the application. Unfortunately,
            these APIs are not from the save provider, thus separate efforts should be done in order to authorize ECAW.
        </p>

    <section id="technologies">
        <h1> 8. Technologies </h1>
        <h3 id="tech_1"> 8.1 Front end - HTML</h3>
        <p> 
            HTML is a marking language used for creating web pages which can be displayed inside a browser. HTML's role is
            to present the information: paragraph, fonts, tables etc. rather than describing the semantics of the document.<br>
            HTML is the abbreviation for Hyper Text Mark-up Language and is the code with resides at the base of the web pages. <br>
            HTML pages are based on tags and have the .html or .htm extension. In their vast majority this tags come in pairs, an opening one
            and a closing one (however there are also cases in which there are single tags). The web navigator interprets this tags displaying
            the result on the screen. The HTML is a language which does not separate lower case from upper case. <br>
            The main page of one domain is the index.html/index.htm file. This page is meant to be displayed automatically on a domain entrance.<br>
            For example, by visiting www.name.com, the page www.name.com/index.html is displayed.<br>
            Some tags allow the usage of attributes with cusom values. 
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_2"> 8.2 Front end - CSS</h3>
        <p> 
            CSS is a standard for element formatting inside a HTML docuemnt. Styles can be attached to the HTML elemenets by
            importing external files or from inside the document through the style tag or the style attribute. CSS can be used
            to format XHTML, XML and SVGL.<br>
            CSS3 is an upgrade which brings in some new attrbiutes and helps the development of new concepts in the web design.<br>
            Some of the most important new modules added to this standard for formatting the HTML elements bring a considerable
            step forward in developing in terms of web design.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_3"> 8.3 Front end - Javscript</h3>
        <p> 
            JavaScript is an OOP language based on protoype concept. It is used especially for introducing new functionalities in web
            pages; the JavaScript code being executed by the browser. The language is well known for its usage inside web site building,
            but it is used for embedded objects access in other applications. It was initially developed by Brendan Eich from Netscape 
            Communication Corporation under the name of Mocha, then LiveScript and finally as JavaScript.<br>
            Beside its name and some syntax similarities, between JavaScript and the Java language there is no link. Like in Java, JavaScript
            has a syntax close to C's one, but it has way more in common with Self language rather than Java.<br>
            Until the beginning of 2005, the last existing version was JavaScript 1.5, which corresponds to the third edition of ECMA-262,
            ECMAScript, in other words, a standard edition of JavaScript. The versions of Mozilla starting from 1.8 Beta 1 have a support 
            for E4X, which is an extension of the language which has to deal with XML, defined in the ECMA-357 standard. The current version
            of Mozilla, 1.8.1 (over which Firefox and Thunderbird 2.0 are built) supports JavaScript 1.7.<br>
            The newest usage of Javascript is related to the scripting of web pages. The web developers can encapsulate in HTML pages
            scripts for diverse activities like data validation or menu creation and other animated effects.<br>
            The browsers store the representation of one web page under a tree object and provide this to the JavaScript, which can start
            manipulate them. The object tree is named Document Object Model (DOM). There is W3C standard for the DOM which should be delivered
            by the browser, which start the idea of writing portable scripts, which should work the same on all browsers. In reality, the W3C
            standard for the DOM is not completely implemented. However the tendency of the browsers is to align the W3C standard, some of them
            still have incompatibility issues (Internet Explorer).<br>
            A more popular technique of building the web pages in the recent times is AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). This technique 
            presumes exeuting HTTP calls in the background without reloading the page, thus updating only parts of the DOM. AJAX permits the building
            of web interfaces with small response time, because the expensive operation of reloading the HTML complete can be removed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_4"> 8.4 Back End</h3>
        <p> 
            Node.js is an environment for running Javascript, open-platform, multi-platform, which executes JavaScript code outside the browser. NodeJS
            allows the developers to use JavaScript for command line commands development and for server-side scripts - running this way, dynamic content
            can be created to be efficiently send to the client. Thus Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying the development of
            web applications around a single programming langauge, way above the different languages for scripts from the server side and client side. <br>
            However js is the standard file extension for JavaScript code, the "Node.js" name does not describe a different type of file in this context but
            is just the name of the product. Node.js has an architecture based on events capable of asynchronous I/O. This development tools pursue optimizing
            the workrate and the scalability inside web applications with lots of I/O operations, togheter with real time web applications (for example:
            programs of communicating in real time ori browser games.)<br>
            The development project shared by Node.js, under the rights of Node.js foundation, is boosted by the collaboration programme of Linux Foundation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_5"> 8.5 Database</h3>
        <p> 
            For the database choice, we are pursuing a full JavaScript ecosystem by picking a non-relational database, more specifically MongoDB. It delivers
            fast and reliable queries which fit onto the main purpose of the application. The documents there will store information about the users and
            theit content, thus: on a way slim data with multiple entries (for users) and bulk data with a lot of entried (for content). A database like
            Mongo will make use of its horizontally scalability in order to store such data. Finally, a cloud based platform like Atlas will help storing
            the data. This will for sure help the deployment and boost the storing component under security and efficiency paradigms of cloud computing.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_6"> 8.6 Version control</h3>
        <p> 
            As already mandatory, the version control used for this application will be git, being hosted finally by GitHub. This is a normal choice after all
            as both developers do have exeperience in working in such environment. Speaking of its usability, git will allow concurent development without
            being an overhead.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tech_7"> 8.7 Server and OS </h3>
        <p> 
            The server used will be provided by NodeJS, due to its powerful means of delivering server work. Express will be considered as an framework in order to
            simplify the server side work. The Web server may not have such workload in order to request powerful tools. The API however will need to 
            have a strong impementation in orde to fullfil the multiple tasks it has. The OS used is not yet relevant, as the deployment will be done over
            multiple OSs (mainly Windows and Linux). The server should be built in a non dependent fashion.

        <h3 id="tech_8"> 8.8 Deployment</h3>
        <p> 
            Heroku is taken in consideration for deployment as it is a reliable and secure way of sharing the final product. This is however to early to decide, and
            for sure not mandatory at this stage as it should not depend on the development stage.
